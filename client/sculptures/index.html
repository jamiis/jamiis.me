     			As I wander about my life in various cities, and as I travel around the globe, I like to pick up old rusty bits of metal and glass, old machinery and trinkets, and anything else that looks interesting. I bring them home, I take them apart, and then I put them back together again.

                    Ned is an assemblage of clock and watch parts, and a wooden artists model. His insides are fully functional and can be turned using a pin located on his back. He currently resides in Chicago and is, like most people, more than the sum of his parts.
